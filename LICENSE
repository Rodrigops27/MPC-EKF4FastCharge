The following files and functions represent adaptations and extensions for the **MPC fast-charge framework**:  
- `OB_step.m` (single-step ROM simulator, based on `outBlend.m`)  
- `EKFmatsHandler.m` (EKF-to-MPC linearization)  
- `iterMPC.m`, `constraintsMPC.m`, `hildreth.m`, `predMat.m` (MPC formulation and solver)  
- `runMPC.m` (main driver script)
